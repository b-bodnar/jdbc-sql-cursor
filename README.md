## JDBS-SQL tutorial

In this project, we learn basic **SQL** and **JDBC**. 

We create `dev_profiles_db` database and two tables: 
- `accounts`, 
- `profiles_table`

Then we rename table `profiles_table` to `profiles`

### Part 1 SQL:

1. Display all profiles from one `department` and sort by `skill`
2. Display `job_title` that accur more than 3 times
3. Display `first_name`, `last_nmae`, `job_title`, `company` for account from one city
4. Find and display the most popular `department` among `profiles` and count of the employees there (define with `username`)
5. Define count of profiles for one `job_title` and `city` for all accounts
6. Display all user accounts by grouping them by `city`
7. Update profiles for accounts where `job_title` contains word _engineer_ and replace it with _developer_

> All SQL scripts are save in dev_profiles.sql file.
